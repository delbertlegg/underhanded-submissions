Exploit is based on Rust macros system. 
Macros export system allows to overwrite the standart macroses. Expoloit replaces standard macro format! with the poisoned one. 
It's difficult to find, because it has no prefix or other. The new one completely matches the standard one and compiler or clippy doesn't do any warnings.
Most of libraries export all macroses, without any notification. It is hard to understand, what path to the macros is used.
Adding the poisoned one to Nickel in mod.rs has no effect on Nickel interface to other libraries.
