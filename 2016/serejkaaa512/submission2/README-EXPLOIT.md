Exploit is based on Rust importing modules system. 
Rust has a `use` keyword, which allows to import names into local scope. Also there is `as` keyword. Exploit uses this two keywords to use trait from one module and all other things from another. 
It's difficult to find, because one must know, that renamed with `as` keyword module can be used in all statements except the statements starting with `use` keyword. So if another module has the same name as renamed with `as` and the same named trait, it is hard to find out that module is using the poisoned trait. Compiler or clippy doesn't do any warnings.
Adding the poisoned module to lib.rs allows to use this trick.
