QuadCurr
========

QuadCurr is the Quadrilateral payment processor. Because P2P is
exciting, QuadCurr makes no distinction between merchants and
customers - it's all just transactions between accounts!

There are three api calls:

 - POST /makeaccount {"currency": "USD"} -> 12345 (new account id)
 - POST /deposit {"account_id": 12345, "amount": 50}
 - POST /transfer {"account_from": 12345, "account_to": 54321, "amount": 50}

The transfer request is lightly rate limited - the more heavily
you request, the slower your requests will go. This is intended
to help us impede arbitrage.

These don't yet have authentication so the initial release will
be restricted to a trusted set of clients - we'll expand this once
a username and password system is set up (very shortly).

Although Quadrilateral is a global business, we don't yet support
currency conversion - currency gets fixed at account creation time
and all transfers must be between accounts set up with the same
currency.

For maximum flexibility for our customers, accounts may overdraw
up to fixed amount depending on their currency.
