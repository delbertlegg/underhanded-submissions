QuadCurr
========

QuadCurr is the Quadrilateral payment processor. Because P2P is
exciting, QuadCurr makes no distinction between merchants and
customers - it's all just transactions between accounts!

There are three api calls:

 - POST /makeaccount {"account_name": "abc", "currency": "USD"}
 - POST /deposit {"account_name": "abc", "amount": 50}
 - POST /transfer {"account_from": "abc", "account_to": "cde", "amount": 50}

These don't yet have authentication so the initial release will
be restricted to a trusted set of clients - we'll expand this once
a username and password system is set up (very shortly).

For convenience, QuadCurr supports currency aliases. For example,
you can use "$" instead of USD! A full list of available aliases
will be released soon.

Although Quadrilateral is a global business, we don't yet support
currency conversion - currency gets fixed at account creation time
and all transfers must be between accounts set up with the same
currency.
